---Tenable Research discovered three vulnerabilities (now remediated) within Google’s Gemini AI assistant suite, which we dubbed the Gemini Trifecta. These vulnerabilities exposed users to severe privacy risks. They made Gemini vulnerable to: search-injection attacks on its Search Personalization Model; log-to-prompt injection attacks against Gemini Cloud Assist; and exfiltration of the user’s saved information and location data via the Gemini Browsing Tool.
