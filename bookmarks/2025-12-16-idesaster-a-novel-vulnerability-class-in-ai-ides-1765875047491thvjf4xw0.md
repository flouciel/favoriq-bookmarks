Autocomplete evolved into AI agents that can autonomously act on behalf of the user. As vendors compete on “productivity” they add additional capabilities that significantly affect the security posture of their products.
Around 6 months ago, I decided to dig into the world of AI IDEs and coding assistants because they were gaining popularity and it was clear they are here to stay. The first vulnerabilities I found were focused on narrow components - a vulnerable tool, writeable agent configuration or writeable MCP configuration that leads to anything from data exfiltration to remote code execution. Those issues are serious, but they only affect a single application at a time (and were publicly disclosed multiple times).
